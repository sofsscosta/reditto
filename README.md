# Reditto

Reditto allows users to sort reddit posts by several categories and permits access to the original reddit post when tapping on a displayed post.

Categories are organized by:

<ul>
<li>Last (based on most recent creating date);</li>
<li>Top (based on highest scored posts);</li>
<li>Polemical (most commented);</li>
<li>Older.</li>
</ul>
